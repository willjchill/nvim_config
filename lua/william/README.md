## My entire custom configuration

### main.lua

Contains my preferred NVIM options and keybindings.

### lazy.lua

Sets up all my customs plugins with Lazy loader.
Also, my LSP is handled by Mason!

*init.lua* in the nvim parent directory sets up these scripts.
*plugins* directory contains configurations for each plugin.
